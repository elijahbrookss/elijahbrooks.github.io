My name is Elijah Brooks, I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer and an aspiring entrepreneur.

### My story

Before I talk about anything else, I LOVE programming. I was introduced into programming through developing games. Ever since creating my first game I've become mesmerized by the ability to bring what I imagine to life. As a game developer I have the ability to bring whatever I can imagine to the eyes of others. This started my journey into Software Engineering.

My first professional experience in programming has to be my time spent at Texas Tech University. During my time at Texas Tech, I learned the principles of computer science which brought about a curiosity for software engineering. After attending Texas Tech I eventually enrolled into Flatiron Coding Bootcamp where I was challenged and taught the ability to bring my imagination to more people than I ever could with game development. Not everyone will play games but everyone will eventually venture to a website.

Now that I've graduated from Flatiron Coding Bootcamp I'm looking for more opportunities to use the skills I've learned and my passion for programming to help impact others the best way I can, while still enjoying every second of it.
